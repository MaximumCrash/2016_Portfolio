It was a fun retelling of adventures with my friends mixed with the world I have written for a long time. <br> <br> Genesis’ soundtrack was composed by FloorBaba & RickyBrugal with the addition of Fluidvolt, Shannon Mason, TobyFox, and many others wonderful composers from the <a href='https://sleepytimejesse.bandcamp.com/album/i-miss-you-earthbound-2012' target='_blank' class='mlink f0 black'>Earthbound: I Miss You</a> album. The game wasn't completed, but I have hopes that one day I will be able to finish this love letter to coming of age.",
